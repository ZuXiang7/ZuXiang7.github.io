I'm Zu Xiang and I am a **final year student** currently studying in Digipen(SIT). I am expected to graduate this **May 2022** and I am currently seeking job opportunities for **software engineer**.

My passion lies with writing clean performant code for **desktop applications** and **computer graphics** primarily with `C++`. I have also studied programming languages such as `GO` and `python` and tech stack such as `Linux` and `Docker` as I enjoy picking up new skills and working with new exciting tech stacks to better myself as a software engineer.

Do check out my projects and internship experience where I detail what I worked on and what I learnt.

Feel free to drop me an email at <zuxiang7@gmail.com> or message me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuxiang/) for any **job opportunities** or **queries**.

**Thank you**
