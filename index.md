I'm Zu Xiang and I am a ***final year student*** currently studying in Digipen(SIT) and I am expected to graduate this ***May 2022***. 

My passion lies with writing clean performant code for ***desktop applications*** and ***computer graphics*** primarily with `C++`. 

After my internship with Autodesk, I came to realize there were still interesting and important techincal skills I am unfamiliar with such as `GO`, `Python` and `Docker`. I have since studied them on my own and I look forward to ***job opportunities*** where I am able to learn more and grow as a software engineer.

Do check out my projects and internship experience where I detail what I worked on and what I learnt.

Feel free to drop me an email at <zuxiang7@gmail.com> or message me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuxiang/) for any queries.

***Thank you***
