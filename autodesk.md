## What I learnt

This was my first ever experience working in a software company and I found it very enjoyable and fruitful.
I believe I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and skills that would only be attainable working in a professional environment such as Autodesk.

In particular, I am very impressed and inspired by the project management techniques and the usage of agile ideology and scrum methods to improve workflow.
I was also given the opportunity to work on front-end web development, a field I have zero experience on before taking on this internship.

I was also able to work on 2 mini project, which helped me experience the difference in working on research related task versus developing features.

My supervisor also helped me organize a brown bag session where I could share my findings, which helped sharpen my presentation skills.

Thanks to the internship, I feel much more prepared and confident in my skills and ability to work as a software developer.
