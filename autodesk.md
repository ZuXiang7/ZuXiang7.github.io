## What I learnt
This was my first ever experience working in a software company and I found it very enjoyable and fruitful. 
I believe I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and skills that would only be attainable working in a professional environment such as Autodesk. 

In particular, I am very impressed and inspired by the project management techniques and the usage of agile ideology and scrum methods to improve workflow. 
I was also given the opportunity to work on front-end web development, a field I have zero experience on before taking on this internship. 

I was also able to work on 2 mini project, which helped me experience the difference in working on research related task versus developing features. 

My supervisor also helped me organize a brown bag session where I could share my findings, which helped sharpen my presentation skills. 

Thanks to the internship, I feel much more prepared and confident in my skills and ability to work as a software developer.
