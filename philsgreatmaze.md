## Description

This is a 2D game project made where we used a school in-house library(Alpha Engine) to develop a game engine. The project spans over 1 semester(3 months) and is completed in a group of 4.

## Role / What I worked on

For this project, I was the tech lead and I worked primarily on

### 2D physics
 - Circle vs Circle collision test
 - Circle vs AABB collision test
 - AABB vs AABB collision test
 - Physics

### Gameplay features
 - Magnets
 - Spikeballs
 - Portals
 - Rotation simulation
 - God mode
 - smoke particles

## What I learnt

This was the first graded project I worked on. Me and my teammates were all inexperienced with coding at the time so we faced a lot of difficulties at the beginning.

Despite that, I feel that we managed to pull ourselves together and developed a well-polished game. We also learnt a lot about working on a software project as a group.

Notably, we used source control for the first time to develop and merge the features we work on into the same codebase. We also learnt the importance of writing clean neat code as we spent a lot of time debugging due to the code being too messy, making it hard to spot mistakes.

The biggest takeaway for me personally was the dangers of over scoping. Nearing the end of the project, I felt we had enough time to develop more features but thankfully my producer stopped me and seeing how I had to spend the entire final week fixing bugs and polishing the game, developing new features would have definitely produced a buggier, unpolished game.
