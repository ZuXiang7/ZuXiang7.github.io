## Description

2D game project where we developed a custom game engine with limited 3rd party libraries and rendering API

## Role / What I worked on

Tools and Debugging Programmer, worked primarily on developing QOL tools for editor and Debugging

## What I learnt

For this project, I joined the group halfway into development so I had to read up the codebase before I was comfortable writing features. I was tasked with developing features such as scene graph with hierarchy relationship and improving the particle system.

Even though they were successfully implemented, the designers later on changed their mind on using some of it as they felt it would be too drastic of a change in the game at such a late stage. With that, I decided to work on polishing the parts of the game instead of developing more features so that I can actually contribute to the team.

I felt that I did a decent job making myself useful and learnt that I should clarify more on what features they need so I do not end up implementing things that go unused.
